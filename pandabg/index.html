		<p class="text">Hello, this is Daniel Tomov, the creator of "Panda Bg." This webstie was made entirely from scratch with no help from other people or external programs. When I decided to make a website as a project, I had no idea what HTML was. I self-taught myself HTML and CSS from books and videos for a week. It took me two weeks to implement my knowledge into this website. By reading those books, I made my site more advanced by using CSS media queries. By using CSS media queries, the website became responsive with the screen size of the device. It has two page breaks. When the screen size less than 900 pixels wide, the site is narrower than when it is veiwed on a device with a screen that is more than 900 pixels wide. Furthermore, when the site is seen on a screen size less than 500 pixels, the elements move around to fit on the page. All these layouts are created strategically so the user doesn't have to scroll sideways.</p>
